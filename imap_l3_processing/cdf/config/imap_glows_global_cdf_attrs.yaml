Descriptor: GLOWS>GLObal Solar Wind Structure
TEXT: >
  The GLObal Solar Wind Structure (GLOWS) is a non-imaging single-pixel Lyman-alpha
  photometer to investigate the global heliolatitudinal structure of the solar wind
  and its evolution during the solar cycle. Additionally, GLOWS investigates the
  distribution of interstellar neutral hydrogen (ISN H) and the solar radiation
  pressure acting on ISN H. The objectives of GLOWS are accomplished by observation
  of the modulation of heliospheric backscatter glow of ISN H (the helioglow)
  along a scanning circle in the sky.
  GLOWS design and assembly is led by the Space Research Center, Warsaw, Poland
  (CBK PAN). See https://imap.princeton.edu/instruments/glows for more details.
