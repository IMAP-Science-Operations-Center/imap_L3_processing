  Lo>IMAP Low-Energy (IMAP-Lo) Energetic Neutral Atom Imager
TEXT: >
  IMAP-Lo is a single-pixel neutral atom imager that delivers energy and position measurements of low-energy Interstellar Neutral (ISN) atoms tracked over the ecliptic longitude >180deg and global maps of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). Mounted on a pivot platform, IMAP-Lo tracks the flow of these ions through the local interstellar medium (LISM) to precisely determine the species-dependent flow speed, temperature, and direction of the LISM that surrounds, interacts with, and determines the outer boundaries of the global heliosphere. IMAP-Lo uses the pivoting field of view (FOV) to view variable angles out to 90deg from the spin axis. This assists IMAP-Lo to pinpoint the intersection between the ISN inflow speed and longitude to uniquely determine the LISM flow vector. Data from IMAP-Lo will help us be able to see from inside the heliosphere what it is like just outside the solar system, our local neighborhood.
