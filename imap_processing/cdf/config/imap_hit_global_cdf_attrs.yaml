Descriptor: HIT>High-energy Ion Telescope
TEXT: >
  The High-energy Ion Telescope (HIT) measures the elemental composition, energy spectra,
  angle distributions, and arrival times of high-energy ions. HIT delivers full-sky
  coverage from a wide instrument field-of-view (FOV) to enable a high resolution of ion
  measurements, such as observing shock-accelerated ions, determining the origin of the
  solar energetic particles (SEPs) spectra, and resolving particle transport in the
  heliosphere. See https://imap.princeton.edu/instruments/hit for more details.
