# ESA Energies table
# Valid start date: 2024-01-01 (from filename)
# This file will be used in processing until a new calibration file is uploaded
# to the SDC with either a higher version number or new date in the filename.
# For details on how the SDC selects ancillary files for processing, see:
# https://imap-processing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-access/calibration-files.html
#
# Values in this file were taken from the mean values extracted by Paul Janzen from
# data take on Nov 4/24 for Hi90 and Feb 8/25 for Hi45.
#
# This file will be used twice in Hi processing:
#   - To generate a mapping from ESA Step to ESA Energy Step for each contiguous HVSCI
#     interval. This is used in L1B DE processing.
#   - In L2 processing to associate an ESA Energy Step to an Energy band.
